# user-behavior-classification-ml

This project implements supervised machine learning models to classify user session behavior and predict online purchase intent using structured behavioral data.

Originally developed in Jupyter Notebook and refactored into a Python script for improved maintainability and repository organization, the project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline including:
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Feature engineering and encoding
	•	Class imbalance handling with SMOTE
	•	Feature scaling
	•	Multi-model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN)
	•	Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices

The repository showcases applied machine learning techniques, analytical reasoning, and clean Python implementation outside a notebook-only environment.
